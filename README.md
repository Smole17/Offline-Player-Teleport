Adds a command that can be used to teleport to players that are currently offline.

Offline Player Teleport requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) if it is not installed.
2. Download Offline Player Teleport from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/offline-player-teleport/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Offline-Player-Teleport/releases).
3. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, permitted players will be able to use the `/offlineplayerteleport` command to teleport to the last saved position of a specified player, even if that player is currently offline.

## Permissions

By default, the `/offlineplayerteleport` command is available to level two operators. If a permission mod that supports permission keys is installed, then the `offlineplayerteleport.command` permission key controls availability instead.
